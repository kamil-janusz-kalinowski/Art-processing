# Art-processing

The 'Art-processing' repository contains various folders with code aimed at artistic image processing and manipulation. For instance, the 'paint_values' folder provides functionalities to colorize grayscale images based on pixel values and generate animations using such transformations. On the other hand, the 'gray_processing' folder houses functions dedicated to manipulating grayscale images.

This project is primarily undertaken for the purposes of personal development and experimentation, offering a playground for exploring creative image processing techniques.
